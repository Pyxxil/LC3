# LC3 Assembler

This is an assembler for the toy language LC3. It works in a similar fashion to the Windows assembler (and is an improvement over my last assembler by a fair margin...).

It allows for some new additional features as well, such as:
 - Character literals
 - Multiple Strings per .STRINGZ
 - A .INCLUDE directive
 - A .SET directive
 - A .LSHIFT directive
 - A .NEG directive
 - A .SUB directive
